# ClozureDB<sup>+</sup> - Relational Database Design Tool

This repository contains the source code for my web-based relational database design application. The goal of this project is to create an online, easy-to-use application that accepts a relation schema and its functional dependencies as input and outputs:
  - All minimum and composite candidate keys and superkeys
  - The set of prime attributes
  - A minimal basis for the given set of functional dependencies
  - The set of all non-trivial functional dependencies that can be found from those given
  - The normal form of the relation schema
  - Decompositions into Boyce-Codd normal form and third normal form.


## To-Do - in no particular order:
- Continue updating README
- Make capabilites and functionality of site more prominent on home page.
- Better documentation and modularization in closure algorithm.
- Get hosted!
